# ports.conf --
#
# This file controls port aggregation and subdivision.  For example, QSFP+
# ports are typically configurable as either one 40G interface or four
# 10G/1000/100 interfaces.  This file sets the number of interfaces per port
# while /etc/network/interfaces and ethtool configure the link speed for each
# interface.
#
# You must restart switchd for changes to take effect.
#
# The Celestica Smallstone has:
#     32 QSFP ports numbered 1-32
#     These ports are configurable as 40G or split into 4x10G ports.
#
#     The X pipeline covers QSFP ports 1 through 16 and the Y pipeline
#     covers QSFP ports 17 through 32.
#
#     The Trident2 chip can only handle 52 logical ports per pipeline.
#
#     This means 12 is the maximum number of 40G ports you can ungang
#     per pipeline. The 12 40G ports become 48 unganged 10G ports,
#     plus the remaining 4 40G ports totals 52 logical ports for that
#     pipeline.
